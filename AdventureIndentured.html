<p>Hello Chosen One, You are now going on an Adventure, pull your pants on and lets go!</p>
<br> <br/>
    <a href=https://ak3.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/12036653/thumb/1.jpg?i10c=img.resize(height:160)>You wake up in an alley way not knowing how or when you got there and start to get up</a>
    <br> <br/> 
    <p>You start to get up but see a homeless person offering you a match</p>
    <a href=http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/14/article-2559333-1B7B85C300000578-28_634x492.jpg> You take the match</a> 
<br> <br/>

<br> <br/>
<p>As you get out the alley way a man leaning on a brick wall asks you</p>
    <p>"You got light friend?"</p>

  <br> <br/>
       <a href=https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.238789872.6352/sticker,375x360-bg,ffffff.u3.png> Sorry man, a few hours later your body is found. You can't escape your death for choosing this path </a> 
    
    <br> <br/>
    <p>Looks like your lost kid. Here you go. Oh and let me give you some advice, head weast. There is where you'll meet her</p>
    
    <a href=https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1k20GSXXXXXbVXFXXq6xXFXXXO/Fidget-Spinner-Toy-Metal-Compass-Hand-Spinner-For-Autism-And-ADHD-Spinner-Fidget-Rotation-Time-Long.jpg> You take a closer look at what the shady man threw at you, its a compass</a>
    <br> <br/>
       <p>You decide to follow the shady man's instructions, and head weast </p> 
    <br> <br/>
    <a href=https://cdn.cgsociety.org/cg/g31/359331/359331_1231510251_600.jpg> Few hours have past, and the scenery starts to change into a swampy forest</a> 
    <br> <br/> 
    <p>In the distance you see a wacky looking house that is in the direction of weast and start walking to it</p> 
    <p>You hear rustling behind you and catch a glimpse of a dark creature, but you think its in your imagination since you've been walking for hours hungry and thirsty. You hear it again but closer, closer, and closer till you can't take it and make a break for the wacky looking house and the creature screams and starts to chase you</p>
    
    <br> <br/>
    <p>As your running towards the wacky house a log in in the way, you either have to jump on top of the log or crwal through the log itself</p>
    <a href=https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/darksouls/images/6/63/You-Died.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130515050459> You jump above the log <a/>
   <br> <br/>
        
        <a href=http://www.wiseacre-gardens.com/wildlife/porcupine-log-inside.jpg> You crawl through the log<a/> 
        <br> <br/>
        <br> <br/>
        <a href=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b7/90/d7/b790d716c9b1118473d6832cf77f8b28--the-netherlands-forest-house.jpg> As you rapidly crawl through the log you start to see the house more clearly and notice that it really is a wacky looking house</a> 
            <br> <br/>
        <p>You reach the house and open the door and close it so fast that you trip over yourself</p>
            <p>As you look up you see something shiny and out of no where you hear a loud thunder noise and a deep voice say</p>
            <p>Chosen One you have made it, you have cleared this trial. For your troubles take this reward.</p>
            <a href=https://resource.supercheats.com/library/640w/farmville-2/p03a-level2.jpg> Here is your reward</a>
            <br><br/>
           <p>Until next time,  Chosen One</p>
